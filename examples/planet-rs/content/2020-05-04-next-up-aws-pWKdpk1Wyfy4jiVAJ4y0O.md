<p>Today I start something new. This is my first day at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.</p>

<p>AWS is choosing Rust more and more. It&rsquo;s an especially excellent choice for problems that require extreme performance, while not sacrificing safety. As more servers are being written in Rust, more people are making use of <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a> and other related libraries.</p>

<p>At AWS, I&rsquo;ll be continuing to work on and foster the Rust networking open source ecosystem, such as with <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest">reqwest</a>, <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">warp</a>, <a href="https://tokio.rs">Tokio</a>, and others. I&rsquo;ll be able to help different teams that are adopting these technologies, advising and teaching, and learning how we can continue to improve the ecosystem. And I&rsquo;ll be surrounded by extremely smart folk that will be stretching these tools in completely unexpected ways. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what we can accomplish!</p>

<p>The hope is that the wonderful ecosystem around <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a> will continue growing, will receive more attention and contributions, and all will benefit from the journey.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to this new chapter!</p>
