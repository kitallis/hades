<blockquote>
<p>Active vibration dampers can reduce or eliminate unwanted vibrations, but
determining a good control policy can be challenging for highly nonlinear
systems. For these types of systems, reinforcement learning is one method to
optimize a control policy with only limited prior knowledge of the system
dynamics. An experimental system was constructed by attaching a permanent
magnet to the end of a pendulum and positioning an electromagnetic actuator
below the resting position of the pendulum. The pendulum was excited with a
sinusoidal force applied horizontally at the pivot point, and the control
input was the applied voltage across the electromagnet. Due to the geometric
arrangement and the strong dependence of magnetic force on distance, the
relationship between the position of the pendulum and the actuation torque
for any control input was highly nonlinear. A generalized version of the
PILCO reinforcement learning algorithm was used to optimize a control policy
for the electromagnet with the objective of minimizing the distance between
the end of the pendulum and the downward position. After 16 s of interaction
with the experimental system, the resulting learned policy was able to
substantially reduce the amplitude of oscillation. This experiment
illustrates the applicability of reinforcement learning to highly nonlinear
active vibration damping problems.</p>
