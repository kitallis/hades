This is just a post about something that grinds my gears a bit more than it reasonably should: I think the habit of applying for CVEs for Rust (and Rust ecosystem libraries) is silly at best and harmful at worst. I think it muddies the waters about what a vulnerability is, and paints an overly negative picture of Rust&rsquo;s security situation that can only lead people to make inaccurate evaluations when contrasting it with other languages like C/C++.
