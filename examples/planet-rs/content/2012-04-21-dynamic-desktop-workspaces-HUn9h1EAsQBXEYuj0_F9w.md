<p>Do you have dynamic workspaces in your window manager?</p>
<p>You might be wondering: what in the world are dynamic workspaces?
A dynamic workspace model allows one to add, remove or rename workspaces on the
fly.
Comparatively, in a typical window manager (or desktop environment)
configuration, you tell the window manager to have <strong>x</strong> number of workspaces.
When you start your window manager, you&rsquo;ll have <strong>x</strong> workspaces, and you can
typically cycle between them using some variation of &ldquo;next workspace&rdquo; or
&ldquo;previous workspace&rdquo; commands.
The disadvantage with this model is that it&rsquo;s difficult to have a large number
of workspaces&mdash;else you might forget which window is on each workspace.</p>
