<p>I&rsquo;d like to break from my normal tradition of focusing almost strictly on
technical content and share a bit of my own personal relationship with Free
and Open Source Software (FOSS). While everyone is different, my hope is that
sharing my perspective will help build understanding, empathy and trust.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be a direct response to the behavior of any other
maintainer. Nor should it be read as a prescription on the ideal behavior of
someone in FOSS. This is meant more as a personal reflection with the hope that
others will use it to reflect on their own relationship with FOSS. There is no
one true path to being a good FOSS maintainer. We all have our own coping
mechanisms.</p>
<p>This is also emphatically not meant as a call for help. This is about
understanding. This is not about a plea to change the economics of FOSS. This
is not about brainstorming ways to improve my mental health. This is not about
bringing on more maintainers. It&rsquo;s about sharing my story and attempting to
increase empathy among the denizens of FOSS.</p>
<p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Anyone involved in FOSS.</p>
