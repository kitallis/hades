<p>In November/December last year, I spent 3 weeks working on a toy
operating system in Rust. (for more, see
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/12/the-rust-os-story/">Writing an OS in Rust in tiny steps</a>,
and <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/kernel/">more</a>).</p>

<p>I wrote a ton of blog posts about it, and I gave a talk about the
process at Mozilla last week
(<a href="https://air.mozilla.org/rust-meetup-march-2014/">the video</a>). At
that talk, a few people asked me if I was going to finish the project.
I said no, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>There are lots of reasons for working on programming projects. Just a
few:</p>

<ul>
<li>to end up with useful code</li>
<li>to learn something</li>
<li>to explore a new concept (see: Bret Victor&rsquo;s demos)</li>
</ul>
