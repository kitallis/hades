Hello! This post will likely be a bit shorter than the last. Today&rsquo;s topic is a few thoughts about how complex it can be to parse human input, and how that interacts with Druid&rsquo;s data model.
Progress I think I&rsquo;m nearly finished tweaking the ingredient editor. I&rsquo;ve spent the better part of a month on just this one view and that might seem like overkill, but for software like this the user experience is the whole point so it&rsquo;s important to get it right.
