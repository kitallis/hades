Well, it&rsquo;s that time again. This is the start of a second series of articles on raytracing in Rust following on from my previous series. This time, I&rsquo;ll be doing all of the rendering on a GPU using Accel - see my previous post on Accel. I thought this would be a good project for learning about GPU programming, see.
Second, this time I want to write a path tracer, rather than a raytracer.
