I used Rust for the first time in late 2013, while trying to write a tiny operating system. At the time, I learned a lot and it was pretty fun, but I found the experience pretty frustrating. There were all these error messages I didn&rsquo;t understand! It took forever to work with strings! Everyone was very nice but it felt confusing.
I just tried Rust again yesterday! Kamal has been trying to sell me (and everyone else) on the idea that if you&rsquo;re doing systems-y work, and you don&rsquo;t know any systems language very well, then it&rsquo;s worth learning Rust.
