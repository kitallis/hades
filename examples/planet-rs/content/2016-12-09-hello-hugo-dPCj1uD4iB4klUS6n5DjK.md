<p>A couple of months ago I shut down my old blog about programming. Although it
sounds cruel to kill a blog, the truth is that it had only one or two articles
of dubious quality.</p>

<p>However, I think there will be interesting things to write about in the coming
months, so here I am with a new blog. After a couple of hours of tinkering
with different themes and settings, this is ready to go online! There will
be no pretexts the next time I want to write&hellip; The only obstacle now is
finding time and a good topic, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>As a fun fact, I am using Hugo to generate the website. The fact that it has
a single binary and no dependencies seems very convenient (this is not
entirely true though, since I am using <code>pygments</code> for syntax highlighting).</p>

<p>Anyway, now everything is in place and this post will make the blog feel
less empty until there is real content.</p>
