<p>A couple weeks ago, the 2019 Rust All-Hands occured in Berlin. This was an opportunity to get a
whole bunch of Rust contributors in the same place for a week, and get decisions done a lot faster
than in a GitHub issue thread or a chatroom. Hard problems were discussed, plans were made, and
serindipitous chance encounters occured that helped propel the project forward in new and exciting
directions.</p>
