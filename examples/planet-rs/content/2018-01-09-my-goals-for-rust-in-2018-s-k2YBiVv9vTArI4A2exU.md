The Rust project has requested blog posts about the project&rsquo;s goals for 2018. I found myself in pretty much complete agreement with Nick Cameron&rsquo;s post, so I thought instead I would write about my own personal goals for Rust in 2018. I am fortunate enough to work on Rust full-time; modulated by the work that needs to get done to accomplish larger team goals, these are some things that I&rsquo;m individually very motivated to make progress on in 2018.
