With the call for #Rust2018 blog posts on how this year&rsquo;s roadmap should look, I figured I&rsquo;d chime in with a few items. Now, I&rsquo;m not using Rust in any shape or form in my day-to-day life (though I&rsquo;d like to!), but I follow along with the community because so many exciting things happen, and I find Rust itself to be a breath of fresh air. In other words, my view is shaped mostly by my role as observer (rather than active participant), and the primary need I want to address is to make it easier to convince coworkers and higher-ups to give Rust a shot.
