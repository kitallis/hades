<p>With <code>csv 1.0</code> just released, the time is ripe for a tutorial on how to read
and write CSV data in Rust. This tutorial is targeted toward beginning Rust
programmers, and is therefore full of examples and spends some time on basic
concepts. Experienced Rust programmers may find parts of this useful, but would
probably be happier with a quick skim.</p>
<p>For an introduction to Rust, please see the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">official book</a>.
If you haven&rsquo;t written any Rust code yet but have written code in another
language, then this tutorial might be accessible to you without needing to read
the book first.</p>
<p>The CSV library is
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv">available on Github</a>
and has
<a href="https://docs.rs/csv">comprehensive API documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a version of this blog post is included as a
<a href="https://docs.rs/csv/1.0.0/csv/tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a>
in the API documentation, and is more likely to be updated as time passes.</p>
<p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Beginning Rust programmers.</p>
