I&rsquo;ve been using Rust on and off since late 2013. 4 weeks ago, I picked up Rust again, and the language is SO MUCH EASIER than it was the last time I tried it (May 2016). I think that&rsquo;s really exciting! So I wanted to talk about why I like using Rust today, and a couple of ideas for where Rust could go in the next year!
