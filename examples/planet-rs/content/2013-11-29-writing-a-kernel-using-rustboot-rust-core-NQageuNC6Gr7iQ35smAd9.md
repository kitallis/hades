Here I am again using the word &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; in a fairly broad sense :)
So today Lindsey Kuper, one of the residents for next week, came by Hacker School! I spent some time a while ago trying to learn some Rust, but got discouraged by the scary pointers and ran away.
But today she pointed out that Rust is for systems programming, and right now I am trying to write an operating system, and this would be the perfect time to pick it up again!
