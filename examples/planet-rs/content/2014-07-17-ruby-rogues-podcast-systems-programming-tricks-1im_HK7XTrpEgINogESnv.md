If you listen to the Ruby Rogues podcast this week, you will find me! We talked about using systems programming tools (like strace) to debug your regular pedestrian code, building an operating system in Rust, but also other things I didn&rsquo;t expect, like how asking stupid questions is an amazing way to learn.
Ruby Rogues also has a transcript of the entire episode, an index, and links to everything anyone referenced during the episode, including apparently 13 posts from this blog (!
