Of late, my main side project has been rug, a stripped-down Git implementation which I&rsquo;m building in Rust. I&rsquo;m following along James Coglan&rsquo;s excellent book Building Git where he lays out how he went about building the same project, in Ruby.
In essence, my project boils down to porting James&rsquo;s code1 into Rust. But why bother with this at all? After all, porting code from one language to another is probably not on your top ten list of cool project ideas.
