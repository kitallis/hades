<p>As a programmer and a fantasy football addict, I am embarassed by the means
through which we must expend ourselves to get data in a machine readable form.
This lack of open source software cripples the community with sub-standard
tools, and most importantly, detracts from some really cool and fun things that
could be done with easily available statistics. Many tools are either out-dated
or broken, or if they work, they are closed source and often cost money.</p>
<p>Yesterday I started work on a new library package that I hope will start to
improve this sorry state of affairs.</p>
