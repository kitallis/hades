In the first post, we looked at the relationship between generators and a more general notion of self-references. In the second post, we narrowed down exactly what problem we need to solve to make generators work, and talked about some solutions that we&rsquo;ve considered but don&rsquo;t feel like we could ship in the near future.
In the original post, I promised that I would have a near term solution by the end of this series.
