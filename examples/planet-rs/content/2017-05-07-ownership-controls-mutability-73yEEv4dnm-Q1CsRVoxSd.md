Some of the first things you learn about in Rust are its ownership and mutability systems. For ownership, you learn about the difference between owned values and borrowed references, where for mutability you learn about immutability by default and how to make a binding mutable. When I learned about this, I took them to be two different permutations that can be applied to data independently of eachother, creating distinct combinations.
