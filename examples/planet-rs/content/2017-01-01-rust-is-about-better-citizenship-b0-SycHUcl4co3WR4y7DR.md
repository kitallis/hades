Steve Klabnik recently invited the Rust community to talk about how we can best sell Rust to others; not by focusing on Rust&rsquo;s safety wins (which can be an abstract benefit), but on the benefits of using Rust in a wider sense. So I&rsquo;ve decided to chime in with what has sold (and keeps me sold!) on Rust. I want to start with a small tour through time to help you understand where I&rsquo;m coming from though, before I start talking about Rust itself.
