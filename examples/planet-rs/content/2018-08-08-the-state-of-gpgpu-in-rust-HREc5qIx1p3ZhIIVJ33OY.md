At work a few months ago, we started experimenting with GPU-acceleration. My boss asked if I was interested. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about programming GPUs, so of course I said &ldquo;Heck yes, I&rsquo;m interested!&ldquo;. I needed to learn about GPUs in a hurry, and that led to my GPU Path Tracer series. That was a lot of fun, but it showed me that CUDA support in Rust is pretty poor.
