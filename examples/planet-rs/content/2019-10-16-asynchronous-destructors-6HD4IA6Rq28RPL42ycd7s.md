The first version of async/await syntax is in the beta release, set to be shipped to stable in 1.39 on November 7, next month. There are a wide variety of additional features we could add to async/await in Rust beyond what we&rsquo;re shipping in that release, but speaking for myself I know that I&rsquo;d like to pump the breaks on pushing forward big ticket items in this space. Let&rsquo;s let the ecosystem develop around what we have now before we start sprinting toward more big additions to the language.
