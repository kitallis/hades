Evan Czaplicki, the creator and maintainer of the Elm project (a project that I love by the way) gave a great talk at Strange Loop last month called &ldquo;The Hard Parts of Open Source.&rdquo; I really enjoyed and valued this talk, and I encourage everyone who is involved in open source to watch it. You can find on YouTube here.
In particular, I got a lot of value out of his identification of three specific harmful patterns of behavior in the open source community, and of his geneological work tracing the origins of those behaviors through the history of the &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; subculture.
