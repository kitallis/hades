It&rsquo;s been a couple of weeks since the last post, and as promised I&rsquo;m back with some progress on the ingredient editor. The last post talked about my goals for this project, technical design decisions based on those goals, and my philosophy on starting challenging projects. This post is more of an experience report from my first few weeks of working with Druid.
