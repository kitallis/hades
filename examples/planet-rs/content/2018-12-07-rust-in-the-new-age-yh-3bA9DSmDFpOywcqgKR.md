<p>With the end of a year comes a new call for reflection, and a new chance to orient ourselves for the
coming year. As with previous years, the Rust Teams have called for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/call-for-rust-2019-roadmap-blogposts.html">a new set of roadmap
posts</a> to help guide the teams’ priorities in 2019. I’ve been doing a little prepwork
myself, and have a few ideas for where to take my own work. Consider this less of a request for the
organization as a whole, and more of a preview for what i’m considering for focusing the Rustdoc
Team on.</p>
