Welcome back to my series of posts on the recipe-management software I&rsquo;m building. If you haven&rsquo;t been following along, you&rsquo;ll probably want to start at the first post. This isn&rsquo;t so much a tutorial series like my posts on raytracing, just me writing about whatever&rsquo;s on my mind as I build out my vision of what a recipe manager should be.
Progress In the last post I finished building the ingredient editor, meaning that I could move on to the recipe editor - probably the most important view in the whole application.
