Previously, I attempted to maintain a blog using GitHub Pages. I was very unsuccessful at actually producing blog posts, though. I don&rsquo;t care a lot about the appearance or maintenance of my blog site. What I want from the experience is the same experience I have writing Rust RFCs (because I have a lot of experience doing that):
 I write some markdown. I commit and push. Other people can read it.
