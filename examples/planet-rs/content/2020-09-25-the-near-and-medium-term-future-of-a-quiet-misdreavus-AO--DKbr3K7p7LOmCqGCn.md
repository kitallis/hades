<p>Here’s another post where i’ll start with the short version: <strong>Next month, i will be starting a
position at Apple, and cutting back how much i code outside of work hours.</strong> There’s a short answer
for how these statements are related - the broad reach and corporate policies of Apple make it
cumbersome to publish or contribute to open-source software - but i also want to look at the
situation in a different light.</p>
