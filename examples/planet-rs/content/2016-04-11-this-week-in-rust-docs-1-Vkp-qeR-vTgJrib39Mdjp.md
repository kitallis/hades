<p>Hello and welcome to <em>This Week in Rust Docs</em>!</p>

<p><em>This Week in Rust Docs</em> is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/this-week-in-rust-docs">on GitHub</a>.
If you find any errors in this week’s issue, <a href="https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/this-week-in-rust-docs/pulls">please submit a PR</a>.</p>

<p>This week’s edition was edited by: <a href="https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez">GuillaumeGomez</a>.</p>

<h1 id="why-this-newsletter">Why this newsletter?</h1>

<p>There isn’t an official Rust docs team yet, but several of us have decided to start working as a team, even though it’s not
official. Here’s what we’ll be working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working on the front-end part of rustdoc.</li>
  <li>Working on error code explanations.</li>
  <li>Improving Rust documentation.</li>
  <li>Improving the Rustbook (also known as “The Book”).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since documentation is a really important part of Rust, why not keep people up-to-date about what’s happening?</p>

<h1 id="latest-news">Latest news</h1>

<p>In the two last weeks, we opened two RFCs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1567">Normalization for long error codes explanations</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1574">More api documentation conventions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once they’re approved, the work on Rust documentation will certainly increase again. They both intend to normalize how to write specific documentation. Please take a look at them. :)</p>

<h1 id="current-opened-issues">Current opened issues</h1>

<p>For now, here are the issues opened for Rust documentation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329">The Standard Library Documentation Checklist</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32777">Add error explanations for all error codes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They both need help to move forward so any contribution is very welcome!</p>
