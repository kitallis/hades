<p>To keep my usual long-windedness from obscuring the point of this post, i’ll put the summary up
front: <em>I’m stepping down from my positions as lead of the Docs.rs Team, and member of the Rustdoc
and Documentation Teams, and ceasing my contributions for the immediate future.</em> The Docs.rs Team
will be co-led by Pietro Albini (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@pietroalbini</code>) and Joshua Nelson (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@jyn514</code>). The Rustdoc Team
continues to be led by Guillaume Gomez (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@GuillaumeGomez</code>), and the Docs Team by Steve Klabnik
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@steveklabnik</code>).</p>
