Oftentimes when I am conversing about the design of Rust with other users - as on RFCs or the internals forum - I witness a peculiar remark about &ldquo;explicitness.&rdquo; It usually goes something like this:
 I do not like Feature Design X because it is too implicit. Magic is okay in Other Language Y, but Rust is supposed to be an explicit language, so we should go with Feature Design Z instead.
