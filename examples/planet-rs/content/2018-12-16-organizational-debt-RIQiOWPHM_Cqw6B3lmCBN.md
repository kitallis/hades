We all know that classic aphorism: Year comes to an end, Rust blog post press send. This is mine.
There are lots of cool technical improvements to Rust that I want the project to achieve this year, and a few in particular that I&rsquo;m definitely going to be putting a lot of time into. But this blog post is going to talk about none of them. Instead, I want to talk about organizational debt, and how badly the Rust project needs to deal with it in 2019.
