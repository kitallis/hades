I&rsquo;m pleased to announce the release of Criterion.rs v0.2, available today. Version 0.2 provides a number of new features including HTML reports and throughput measurements, fixes a handful of bugs, and adds a new, more powerful way to configure and construct your benchmarks. It also breaks backwards compatibility with the 0.1 versions in a number of small but important ways. Read on to learn more!
What is Criterion.rs? Criterion.rs is a statistics-driven benchmarking library for Rust.
