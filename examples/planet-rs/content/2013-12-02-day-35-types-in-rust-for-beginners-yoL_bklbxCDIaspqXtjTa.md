I found understanding Rust types really confusing, so I wrote up a small tutorial for myself in an attempt to understand some of them. This is by no means exhaustive. There is a types section in the manual, but it has nowhere near enough examples.
This assumes that you&rsquo;ve read the sections about owned and borrowed pointers in the Rust tutorial, but not much else.
I&rsquo;m not talking about managed pointers (@) at all.
