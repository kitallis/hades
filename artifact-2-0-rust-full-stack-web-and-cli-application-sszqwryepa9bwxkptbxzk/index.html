  <h1>Artifact 2.0 Rust Full Stack Web And Cli Application</h1>

  
    <p style="font-size:90%;">
      Posted on <time datetime="2018-07-16T00:00:00+00:00">July 16, 2018</time>
      by <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitiral.github.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;16&#x2F;artifact-2.0-rust-full-stack-web-and-cli-application.html">Vitiral</a>

    </p>
  

  <p>After at least 6 months of effort (and interruptions‚Ä¶ so many interruptions)
I have finally completed the complete rewrite of artifact ‚Äì including
rewriting the Web UI to be in rust compiled into web assembly. <a href="https://github.com/vitiral/artifact/releases">2.0 is
complete and you can download it here (for linux only
ATM</a>)</p>
<p>This release spans a huge amount of effort. The TLDR version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I felt like I needed a cohesive CLI SDK and so I created the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-crates/ergo">ergo</a> crate. This included several
other crates created by me:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vitiral/path_abs">path_abs</a> for better path handling.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vitiral/std_prelude">std_prelude</a> for glob importing what I need.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vitiral/termstyle">termstyle</a> for cleaner terminal styles.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vitiral/taken">taken</a> for taking ownership.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vitiral/stfu8">stfu8</a> for serializing/deserializing
arbitrary bytes that are ‚Äúmostly‚Äù utf8 compliant (i.e. paths).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I used <a href="https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew">yew</a> for developing the frontend. I ended up
contributing a fair amount to both yew and <a href="https://github.com/koute/stdweb">stdweb</a> but
these frameworks were <em>surprisingly stable</em>. I also made a few crates:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vitiral/jrpc">jrpc</a>: for easily creating JSON-RPC
requests and handling responses.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vitiral/yew_simple">yew_simple</a>: a simpler (in my
opinion) imlementation of several yew services. It is important to note
that yew is flexible enough that this is even possible :)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>What I ended up with is the first (to my knowledge) full stack application in
rust that is more than a toy. Artifact is a reasonably complex piece of software,
and rust delivers its promises of speed and stability even at the cutting edge of
the web.</p>
<h2 id="why-rewrite-everything">Why Rewrite Everything?</h2>
<p>The first question is probly why I decided a complete rewrite was necessary.
There are two answers: for fun and because I initially wrote artifact when I
was just learning rust for the first time and it <em>showed</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted to write artifact ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù ‚Äì using standardized libraries and
split into several reusable crates. However, the standardized those libraries
didn‚Äôt really exist yet (or at least they weren‚Äôt cohesive) so I went about
building ergo. It was my way of giving back to the fantastic rust
community :)</p>
<p>The other reasons to rewrite were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speed: I wanted to make the implementation completely parallel, and I did.
It is <em>blazingly</em> fast now.</li>
  <li>Simplicity: the filesystem interface now has an API which acts like a CRUD
database. You simply give it a list of operations (create/modify/delete) and
it makes sure they are valid and consistent and performs them. This made
implementing the CLI and Server layers trivial, as they could both use this
simple interface.</li>
  <li>New Features: I added several new features that the old library made
difficult to add and test.
    <ul>
      <li>Sub Artifacts: you can add sub-artifacts using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[.subart]]</code> syntax in the
text of any artifact, making it possible to split up the definition
of how to implement the artifact in source code. This also includes
test subarts (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[.tst-subart]]</code>).</li>
      <li>Markdown format: the default way to specify artifacts is now using
an extended form of commonmark markdown.</li>
      <li>The docs (including the Simple Quality book) are now distributed directly
with the web app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-was-wasm--yew">How was WASM / yew?</h2>
<p>Rewriting the frontend in rust using yew (and compiling to webassembly) was
truly fun and exciting. There was definitely a few areas that needed
improvement; and being willing to contribute to fix your own issues was
<em>critical</em> with the ecosystem where it is at now ‚Äì but the responsiveness of
the rust developers has never ceased to amaze me.</p>
<p>Probably the most amazing thing about writing your whole stack in a single
langauge is code reuse. I have a single crate, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">artifact-ser</code> with the
serialization datatypes and logic that can be used anywhere in the stack.
This allows me to implement code once and use it anywhere ‚Äì a benefit
that can seriously not be overstated!</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I love rust, it is definitely my favorite language at the moment. Writing
a full stack application in pure rust has been an amazing experience.</p>
<p>The highlights however are definitely my interactions with the community. After
my <a href="https://vitiral.github.io/2018/01/17/rust2018-and-the-great-cli-awakening.htm">Rust and the Great CLI
Awakening</a>
blog post I was invited to be on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/cli-wg">CLI Working
Group</a>. Unfortunately, that
pulled too much of my time away from rewriting artifact so I had to drop out.
However, my experience there and with the WASM folks has been nothing but
positive. Its been said before and I‚Äôll say it again: Rust has a great
community!</p>
<p>There is still much work to be done for artifact. For one thing I need to
figure out how to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cargo-web</code> in CI for mac and windows so that I can
distrubute artifact for those platforms. I also need to finish end to end
testing (including using frontend testing using rust, more on that later!).</p>
<p>However, one of the primary distractions over the last several months has
been interviewing at Google‚Ä¶ and the distractions paid off! I will be
starting as a Test Engineer at Google working on <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/05/07/volvo-google-assistant-cars/">Android
Auto</a>. This is
super exciting, but will not leave a lot of time for working on artifact.
Therefore this blog post is basically also a notice that I will be on haitus
for the next several months as I get up to speed on everything Googly.</p>
<p>If you find artifact valuable, please leave
<a href="https://vitiral.github.io/artifact/docs/Feedback.html">feedback</a>. Help
in maintaining it would also be much appreciated :).</p>
