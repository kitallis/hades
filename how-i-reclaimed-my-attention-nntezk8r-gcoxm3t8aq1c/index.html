  <p>It feels like boredome has been nearly extinguished, but our resiliency to it
is lower than ever. Our smartphone is always at hand, and if you pay attention
you can likely find yourself checking it nearly every second of downtime ‚Äì
becomming a default impulse that hapens so quickly there isn‚Äôt even an
<em>opportunity</em> to resist it.</p>
<p>However, I believe boredom has immense value. I find some of my most creative
and enjoyable moments to be when I am otherwise largely bored. For instance,
it‚Äôs hard to really <em>enjoy</em> music if you are not otherwise bored ‚Äì as music
cannot be fully appreciated while doing another task. More important, being
resilient to boredom allows you to have more freedom to direct your attention
to the things you value.</p>
<p>This blog post is not about the value of boredom in our lives, nor about the
value in having freedom in how we apply our attention. It is assumed that you
already see the value of those things or at least how they could be valuable.
Instead, this is about some of the general strategies I employ to reduce my
levels of distraction and live what I feel is a moderatly happy life.  I‚Äôve
struggled with attention addiction (addiction to video games, streaming website
information, etc) for most of my adult life, and have built up a large variety
of methods and tricks to reduce their hold on me.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: make it very difficult to ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù do distracting behavior</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, (1) remove apps like twitter, reddit, facebook, games etc from
your phone. (2) Since these are all accessible via the web, <strong>also remove
chrome/safari</strong> (and any other browser) as well. Technically on most phones you
can only ‚Äúdisable‚Äù these things, but the point is not to make it impossible to
distract yourself (you can never accomplish that) but to provide a barrier
against it being an <em>impulse</em>. Personally, I have also disabled the App Store
and the Search functionality built-into the phone, even disabling Gmail for a
few weeks at a time, since I found myself impulsively using that.</p>
<p>Finally, (3) have a laptop/computer that is for ‚Äúgetting things done.‚Äù Most
likely, this is your work computer. (For linux/mac) go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/hosts</code> and
disable sites that distract you like so:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>127.0.0.1     facebook.com
127.0.0.1     www.facebook.com
127.0.0.1     reddit.com
127.0.0.1     www.reddit.com
# ... etc
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Step 2: create consequences</strong></p>
<p>Write a contract with yourself; even better a best friend or significant other.
It should have:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What (significant) behaviors you are not allowed to do.</li>
  <li>The consequences for doing those behaviors.</li>
</ol>
<p>For me, since I don‚Äôt like sports, doing any of the distracting behaviors (for
more than 1 minute) requires me to purchase or wear Denver Broncos memoribilia.
If I do distracting behaviors 10ish times, I have to get a Denver Broncos
tatoo.</p>
<p>For smaller behaviors, like compuslively checking my phone, I have a
spreadsheet where I keep track of how often I compulively checked my phone that
day. This means that if I compusively open my phone, I have an immediate
consequence of needing to record it.</p>
<p>I found the book Atomic Habbits by James Clear useful as well. You might as
well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find ways to still be connected (when useful)</strong></p>
<p>I have a ‚Äúpersonal laptop‚Äù which I can only use after I put my kids to bed for
about an hour and a half. This is where I do my open source work, and also
where I briefly check some tech news. The news is blocked on my work computer
for obvious reasons, but it is nice to be able to stay up to date. I try to
stay away from most news. I find it tends to depresses me even though
I have no control over it, which has limited value.</p>
<p>I also still listen to podcasts, audiobooks and music on my phone, especially
while running or doing chores. This lets me stay connected while doing
activities that I value.</p>
<p>For me personally, I have completely abandoned video games, reddit and (non
educational) youtube. This is the nature of my own addiction, which is akin
to an alcoholic not being able to ‚Äújust have one drink‚Äù.</p>
<p>Also for me personally, I have found outlets for some of my addictions. I find
(open source) programming nearly as enjoyable/distracting as playing video
games, but with a much larger long-term benefit. Therefore, I do open source
programming for a large chunk of my freetime. My recent project is

<p><strong>Conclussion</strong></p>
<p>Come up with your own methods or mimick mine ‚Äì what‚Äôs important is that you
have strategies. Also, it is important that you accept failure, because you
will fail alot. You have your whole life to figure out how to reduce
distraction and pay attention to the things that matter, so don‚Äôt stress out
about it. Don‚Äôt stress, but start right now.</p>
