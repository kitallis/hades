  <p>This is research I conducted at Duke University to determine the sensitivity of
final field position to punts&rsquo; initial conditions in American football. Here‚Äôs
a sample figure from the paper:</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This is the abstract from the conference paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The starting field position is often a deciding factor in an American football
game. In the case of a defensive stop, a kick, known as a punt, is used to give
the receiving team a field position that is more advantageous to the kicking
team when possession changes. The goal of the punter is to kick the ball along
a desired flight path, where a delicate balance between the distance traveled
before impact, hang time in the air, and the distance traveled after bouncing
is favorable for the kicking team. However, the punter has only imprecise
control over the initial conditions, such as the angular velocity, linear
velocity, and orientation of the football. Due to the highly nonlinear behavior
of the football, from aerodynamic and impact forces, even small changes in
initial conditions can produce large changes in the final position of the
football, but there may be regions of initial conditions with relatively
consistent results. If punters could target such large contiguous regions of
initial conditions with desirable football paths, they could improve their
chances of successful kicks.</p>
<p>For nonlinear systems, basins of attraction diagrams are often used to
graphically display the initial conditions that lead to different final
attractors. In this case, the regions of initial conditions that lead to a
desirable final field position can be grouped and shown graphically. A
numerical simulation program was developed including models for aerodynamic
flight and bouncing of the irregularly shaped football. The flight model used
fourth order Runge‚ÄìKutta integration of the equations of motion of the
football, including gravitational and aerodynamic forces and moments with
empirical lift, drag, and yaw coefficients in three dimensions. The bounce
model was based on an empirical two-dimensional coefficient of restitution
model that was published in the literature. The behavior of a football in
flight and during bouncing was simulated for a range of initial angular
velocities and launch angles, and the characteristics of the flight paths were
analyzed. The characteristics of some regions of initial conditions were
relatively sensitive to small changes, while other regions were relatively
uniform. This shows that this approach, with a quantitatively accurate bounce
model, could be practically applied to develop a guide for punters to optimize
their kicks. With such a guide and sufficient practice, punters could select
and target the larger regions of initial conditions that produced desirable
behavior, which would improve their chances of successful punts.</p>
